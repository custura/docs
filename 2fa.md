## Introduction

`2FA` is implemented to better protect both a `user's` credentials and the resources the user can access. `Two factor authentication` provides a higher level of security than authentication methods that depend on `single-factor authentication` (SFA), in which the user provides only one factor -- typically, a password or passcode. `Two factor authentication` methods rely on a user providing a password as the first factor and a second, different factor -- usually either a security token or a biometric factor, such as a fingerprint or facial scan.

`Two factor authentication` adds an additional layer of security to the authentication process by making it harder for attackers to gain access to a person's devices or online accounts because, even if the victim's password is hacked, a password alone is not enough to pass the authentication check.

`Two factor authentication` (2FA) option can be enabled by user from Profile Edit page.

If you already have the Google Authenticator application on your phone, scan the QR code and enter the code of 6 dignits to complete activation.

Store these recovery codes in a secure password manager. They can be used to recover access to your account if your two factor authentication device is lost.
